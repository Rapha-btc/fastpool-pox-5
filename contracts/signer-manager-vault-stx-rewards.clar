;; title: fastpool-stx-rewards-signer-manager
;; A FAST Pool signer manager for pox-5 that pays stacking rewards in STX.
;;
;; pox-5 pays a pool's rewards in sBTC. This contract claims that pot, swaps it
;; for STX on one or more DEXs, and distributes the STX to its stackers
;; pro-rata. Everyone locked against this contract receives STX at the same
;; execution price; there is no per-stacker reward preference. A stacker who
;; wants sBTC or L1 bitcoin stakes against a different FAST Pool signer manager
;; instead.
;;
;; A cycle moves through four steps:
;;
;;   1. claim-rewards   (anyone)   pox-5 -> here and records the cycle pot.
;;   2. pin-shares      (anyone)   freeze the pro-rata denominator.
;;   3. fund-swap-vault (anyone)   send the cycle's net sBTC to its vault.
;;   4. finalize-swap-vault        attribute returned STX to the cycle.
;;   5. distribute-*    (anyone)   pay stackers.
;;
;; STX stacking only. Bond stacking and pox-addr calldata are both refused in
;; `validate-stake!`.
;;
;; See docs/plan-fastpool-stx-rewards.md for the full design rationale.

;;
;; pox-5 calls `validate-stake!` on every path that INCREASES a stacker's
;; shares, which is enough to maintain the mirror. It never calls back on
;; `unstake`, so the mirror can drift -- but only ever upward, since every
;; unseen change is a decrease. That one-sidedness is what makes a single
;; signer-level equality check against pox-5 sufficient proof of exactness:
